## Power Supply

The regualator on the IMU board can supply 3.3V for the Microcontroller, Sensors, SD and Radio. The GPS can use it's own on-board regulator.

Is 4.5V nominal voltage is acceptable? Can the GPS keep going down to about 3.6V with no loss of performance?

## Power Consumption

* Microcontroller - 5mA
* Sensors - 7mA
* GPS - 70mA
* Radio - 18mA
* SD Card - 30mA

* Safety Margin - 20mA

* Total - 150mA
